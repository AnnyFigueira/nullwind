# Icons

You're probably familiar with icons, they're everywhere. They're used to represent actions, objects, and concepts. They're used to communicate information and help users navigate your app.

## Usage

Import the icon and render it in your component. You can adjust SVG properties through props:

### Feather Icons

```jsx
import { IconTwitter } from "nullstack-feather-icons";

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <IconTwitter
      size={36} // set custom `width` and `height`
      color="red" // set `stroke` color
      stroke={3} // set `stroke-width`
    />
  );
};
```

You can find the full list of icons [here](https://feathericons.com/).
